            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Axioms play a central role in constructing the real numbers and formalising mathematical concepts. For example, if we're working in the usual decimal system (base 10), we know \(5+2 = 2+5\). This can be easily explained on a number line: starting at 2 and moving along 5 units is the same as starting at 5 and moving along 2 units. This symmetry applies to all natural numbers. If you start at \(n\) units and move along \(m\) units, it is the same as starting at \(m\) units and moving along \(n\) units for some \(n,m\in\mathbb{N}\).
            </p>
            <p>
                But what about the other real numbers? How would you explain \(e+\pi = \pi + e\)? You can't directly appeal to a number line like with the naturals, and their behaviour isn't self-evident in the same way. To explain properties like commutativity for <em>all</em> real numbers, we need a more foundational approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                One rigorous way is to build the real numbers starting from the naturals, as we can easily explain their self-evident properties. By constructing the integers, rationals, and reals from the naturals, we can define the properties of each set using the properties of the naturals. Understanding the properties of the naturals and eventually all real numbers will provide a rigid foundation that we can use in the study of Real Analysis.
