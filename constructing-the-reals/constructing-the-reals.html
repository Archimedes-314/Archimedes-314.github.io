            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Why Rigor Becamse Necessary</h3>
                    <p>
                        In everyday life, we often use maths without thinking twice, whether it's basic arithmetic 
                        in cooking, or algebra in budgeting. For centuries, this intuitive approach 
                        was sufficient for practical purposes. However, as mathematics advanced to more complex fields,
                        serious foundational problems began to emerge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Early calculus relied heavily on intuitive notions such as "infinitely small quantities" and
                        "instantaneous change". While these ideas led to spectacular successes in physics and
                        engineering, they were not logically precise, and contradictory arguments often coexisted 
                        without clear resolution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By the early 19th century, this lack of precision had become untenable. Mathematicians began to
                        ask not only <em>what</em> mathematics could compute, but <em>why</em> its methods worked at all.
                        This marked the beginning of what is now called the <strong>rigorisation of mathematics</strong>.
                    </p>

                <h3>A Simple Question That Reveals a Deep Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Consider the familiar question:
                        \[
                            0.\bar{9} = 1 \; ?
                        \]
                        Informally, many arguments claim this equality is "obvious", often appealing to properties of
                        real numbers such as density or limits. For example, one may argue that if two real numbers are
                        distinct, then there must be another real number strictly between them. This can be shown false
                        as follows:
                    </p>

                    <div class="example" data-collapsible="true">
                        Take two numbers \(a,b\in\R\) where \(a\lt b\). From the desity property, there must exist a 
                        \( c=(a+b)/2 \in \R \) where \(a \lt c \lt b\)
                        <div class="working">
                            <h4>Working:</h4>
                            For two numbers \(a,b \in \R \), \(a \lt b\) implies:
                            \begin{align*}
                                a &\lt b\\
                                \implies a+a &\lt a+b\\
                                \implies 2a &\lt a+b\\
                                \implies a &\lt \frac{a+b}2\\\\
                            \end{align*}
                            A similar argument shows that:
                            \begin{equation} 
                                a \lt b \implies \frac{a+b}2 \lt b
                            \end{equation}
                            Putting these together results in: \(\displaystyle a \lt \frac{a+b}2 \lt b\)
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Using this idea, one might attempt to argue that there can be no real number strictly between
                        \(0.\bar{9}\) and \(1\), and therefore they must be equal.
                    </p>

                    <div class="example" data-collapsible="true">
                        There exists no \(x\in\R\) where \( 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1 \)
                        <div class="working">
                            <h4>Working:</h4>
                            Suppose, for contradiction, \(0.\bar{9} \lt 1\). Then, from the previous example, assume
                            that there exists an \(x \in \R\) such that \( 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1 \).

                            Define the decimal \( 0.\bar{9} \) as the limit of the sequence \( (0.\bar{9})_n \) given by:
                            \begin{align*}
                                (0.9)_n &:= \suma{i=1}{n}{\frac{9}{10^i}}\\
                                0.\bar{9} &:= \Lim{n}{\infty}{(0.9)_n}
                            \end{align*}

                            Note that for all \( n \in \N \), we have:
                            \[
                                (0.9)_n \lt 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1
                            \]

                            Now observe:
                            \[
                                (0.9)_n + \frac{1}{10^n} = 1
                            \]
                            
                            This can be proven though induction. Due to the proofs simplicity, it will be left as an excersise
                            for the reader. This results in:

                            \[
                                1-x \lt 1-(0.9)_n = \frac{1}{10^n}
                            \]

                            And since \( 0 \lt x \lt 1 \), it follows that: \( 0 \lt 1-x \lt 10^{-n} \).

                            But by the <em>Archimedean Property</em>*, for every positive real number \(\eps > 0\), there exists 
                            \(n \in \N\) such that \(10^{-n} \lt \eps\). In particular, there is no real number \(x\) such that 
                            \(0 \lt 1 - x \lt 10^{-n}\) for all \(n \in \N\), because \(10^{-n} \To{n}{\infty} 0\). Therefore, 
                            such an \(x\) cannot exist.

                            <br><br>

                    </div>


                    <p>
                        However, this reasoning quietly assumes two things:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>That the real numbers genuinely possess the density property.</li>
                        <li>That the infinite decimal \(0.\bar{9}\) already corresponds to a well-defined real number.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>
                        Neither assumption is trivial. In fact, both depend on deeper structural properties of the real
                        number system, properties that themselves must be justified. This raises a fundamental question:
                        <em>How far back must we go before our mathematical claims no longer depend on unexamined
                        assumptions?</em>
                    </p>

                <h3>The 19th-Century Foundations of Analysis</h3>

                    <p>
                        The first major progress toward rigorous foundations came not from logic, but from analysis.
                        During the early-to-mid 1800s, mathematicians such as Bernard Bolzano, Niels Abel, Augustin-Louis
                        Cauchy, and Karl Weierstrass systematically eliminated the vague notions that had plagued
                        calculus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Limits, continuity, and convergence were reformulated using precise \( \eps \) - \( \delta \)
                        definitions. This work made calculus logically reliable, but it also exposed a deeper problem:
                        the real numbers themselves were being used without a clear definition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In response, several independent constructions of the real numbers emerged later in the 19th
                        century. Richard Dedekind defined real numbers using <em>cuts</em> of the rationals, while Karl
                        Weierstrass and Georg Cantor developed constructions based on Cauchy sequences. These approaches
                        showed that irrational numbers could be rigorously built from rational numbers alone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Around the same time, William Rowan Hamilton introduced ordered pairs of real numbers as a
                        foundation for the complex numbers, demonstrating that even seemingly new kinds of numbers
                        could be constructed from simpler ones.
                    </p>

                <h3>Axioms and the Natural Numbers</h3>

                    <p>
                        Yet another foundational issue remained: the rational numbers themselves depend on the natural
                        numbers. Using ideas developed by H. G. Grassmann and Richard Dedekind, Giuseppe Peano introduced
                        a small collection of axioms that precisely describe the structure of the natural numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These <em>Peano axioms</em> do not attempt to prove what numbers are. Instead, they specify how
                        numbers behave. From them, addition, multiplication, and the rational numbers can be
                        systematically constructed.
                    </p>

                <h3>Logicism and Its Limits</h3>

                    <p>
                        By the late 19th century, it had become plausible that large portions of mathematics could be
                        derived from a small set of primitive principles. Gottlob Frege sought to show that arithmetic
                        itself could be derived purely from logic, a philosophical position known as <em>logicism</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frege developed the necessary logical machinery in 1879, and by the 1890s had produced detailed
                        derivations of arithmetic. However, the discovery of paradoxes, most famously Russell's
                        Paradox, revealed deep inconsistencies in naive logical systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In response, Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell collaborated on <em>Principia
                        Mathematica</em>, attempting to rebuild mathematics within a carefully constrained logical
                        framework. While enormously influential, this project ultimately revealed the immense
                        complexity required to formalise even basic arithmetic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the 1930s, Kurt G&ouml;del proved his incompleteness theorems, showing that any sufficiently rich
                        axiomatic system cannot be both complete and capable of proving its own consistency. G&ouml;del did
                        not show that mathematics lacks foundations, but rather that no single system can capture all
                        mathematical truth from within itself.
                    </p>

                <h3>What Axioms Really Are</h3>

                    <p>
                        Modern mathematics therefore proceeds axiomatically. Axioms are not self-evident truths, nor
                        arbitrary assumptions. Instead, they are carefully chosen principles that capture the essential
                        structure of the objects we wish to study.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the sections that follow, we begin with the axioms for the natural numbers and show how the
                        rationals and real numbers can be constructed step by step. This approach reveals that the real
                        number system is in fact the result of a long and carefully reasoned historical development.
