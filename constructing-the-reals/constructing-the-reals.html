            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Why Formal Mathematics is Needed</h3>
            <p>
                In everyday life, we often use maths without thinking twice, whether it's basic arithmetic 
                in cooking, or algebra in budgeting. But as we move toward more advanced topics such as 
                calculus and analysis, we begin to notice that many familiar ideas are not as precise as 
                we once assumed. Some concepts work intuitively but lack the rigor needed for deeper 
                mathematical reasoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, consider this familiar question: Is \(1 = 0.\bar{9}\)? 
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a common internet problem that often generates plenty of controversy. One popular
                argument for why it's true relies on the idea that the real numbers are dense: for any two 
                real numbers, there <em>must</em> exist another real number between them. 
                At first glance, this property seems obvious. For any two numbers \(a,b\in\R\), we must have 
                \(a\lt b \implies a\lt (a + b)/2\lt b\). 
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                Take two numbers \(a,b\in\R\) where \(a\lt b\). We can take the following:
                \begin{align*}
                    a &\lt b\\
                    \implies a+a &\lt a+b\\
                    \implies 2a &\lt a+b\\
                    \implies a &\lt \frac{a+b}2\\\\
                \end{align*}
                A similar argument shows that:
                \begin{equation} 
                    a \lt b \implies \frac{a+b}2 \lt b
                \end{equation}
                Putting these together results in: \(\displaystyle a \lt \frac{a+b}2 \lt b\)
            </div>

            <p>
                Using this fact, we could show that there exists no real number \(x\) such that 
                \(0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1\). However, this argument relies on two foundational ideas: 
                the real numbers geniunely have the density property, and that the numeral \(0.\bar{9}\)
                corresponds to well-defined real number.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, to use this argument rigorously, we must first justify these starting points.
                But those justifications themselves rely on earlier principles.
                This leads to a deeper question: <em>How far back must we go to justify our claim; is there
                a point at which our claims attain objective validity</em>?
            </p>


            <h3>How We Formalise Mathematics</h3>

            <p>
                Since the late 19th century, mathematicians have been fascinated in formalising the foundations of mathematics. 
                Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell famously pursued this topic in their monumental work <em>Principia 
                Mathematica</em>, where they attempted to build the real number system&mdash;and eventually the whole of
                mathematics&mdash;from an entirely explicit and assumption-free logical framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in the 1930s, Kurt G&ouml;del and his incompleteness theorems proved that this project is fundamentally 
                impossible; any system complex enough to do basic arithmetic will include assumptions about the natural numbers
                that can not be proven within the system itself. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This leads us to an important question: <strong><em>If no system can be both complete and consistent, how can we 
                build a rigorous foundation for mathematics?</em></strong> G&ouml;del's work shows that we cannot prove the consistency 
                of arithmetic from within arithmetic itself. Nevertheless, we can still describe the basic structure 
                of the natural numbers. We can describe the principles that align with our intuitive understanding 
                rather than being derived purely from logic. These guiding principles are called <em>axioms</em>. 
                Although they cannot be proven within the very system they generate, they serve as the starting points 
                from which more complex and dependable mathematical theories can be developed.
            </p>


            <p>
                In the sections below, we will explore the axioms of the real number system. These axioms allow us 
                to build the rigorous mathematical theories that underpin calculus, real analysis, and beyond.
            </p>

                    and construct the basic operations.
