                The Axioms

                <li> \(0\in\N_0\)</li>
                <li> \(\forall n\in\N_0, \ \S(n)\in\N_0\)</li>

            </ol>
            
            <p>
                In this section, we will look into the meaning and purpose of each axiom.

            <h2>Notation</h2>
            <p>There are two common definitions of the set \(\N\). Those are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\N := \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\)</li>
                <li>\(\N := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The definition you use depends on context. But within analysis branches, it's common to define
                \(\N := \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\), and \(\N_0 := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\). That is the definition
                we will be using.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will also be using the function \(\S(n)\) while exploring the Peano Axioms and the construction of
                the reals. As stated in the previous page, this function is called the <em>successor function</em>, 
                and maps a natural number \(n\) to the number \(n+1\). Although we know explicitly that \(\S(n)=n+1\), 
                we cannot define the successor in terms of addition, because addition itself depends on the successor. 
                That would be circular.
            </p>

            <h2>The First Four Axioms</h2>
            The first four axioms are simple properties of the natural numbers and don't require much explanation. The 
            axioms translated into words are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    \(0\) is a natural number. This simply specifies the starting point of the natural numbers. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The successor of any natural number is a natural number. This is known as closure under the successor 
                    function, and results in the iterative process \(\N_0 = \{0,\ \S(0)=1,\ \S(1)=2,\ \S(2)=3, \ldots\}\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(0\) is not the successor of any natural number. This ensures the natural numbers have a "beginning" and 
                    that the iterative process doesn't loop back to \(0\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The successor function is injective. This means that each natural number has a unique successor. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>The Axiom of Induction</h2>
            <h3> What it's saying</h3>
            <p>
                Now we'll look into the fifth axiom:
                \(\underbrace{\forall A\subseteq\N_0}_{\text{Arbitrary Subset}}, \ 
                \underbrace{(0\in A \ \land \ (\forall n \in A, \ \S(n)\in A) )}_{\text{Conditions}} 
                \implies \underbrace{A=\N_0}_{\text{Conclusion}}\) <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This axiom has three main components:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose any subset \(A \subseteq \N_0\).</li>
                    <li>Assume it satisfies the two stated conditions.</li>
                    <li>Conclude the necessary result if the conditions are met.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                The first condition is \(0\in A\), requiring our subset to contain \(0\). The next condition is 
                \(\forall n\in A, \ \S(n)\in A\), meaning that for any member of \(A\), it's successor is also in \(A\).
            </p>
            <p> 
                So if \(0\) is in \(A\) and the successor of all numbers in \(A\) is also in \(A\), the axioms of induction forces 
                \(A=\{0, \S(0), \S(\S(0)), \ldots\}\), which is exactly \(\N_0\).
            </p>

            <h3>Why it's important</h3>
            <p>
                Say we have some proposition \(P\), and we want to prove that the proposition is true for all natural numbers. A simple way to do this
                is to start with the set \(A:=\{n\in\N_0 \ : \ P(n)\text{ is true}\}\) which contains the set of naturals numbers for which
                \(P\) is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we can show \(P(0)\) is true. That is, the proposition is true when the argument is \(0\). If that holds, we can then say
                \(0\in A\).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we assume that \(n \in A\). That is, we assume \(P(n)\) is true for some arbitrary natural number \(n\).  
                Under this assumption, we then show that \(P(\S(n))\) is also true. If we can prove this in a way that doesn't 
                restrict \(n\) to any specific value, then we can claim \(n\in A \implies \S(n)\in A\).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we've shown that \(0 \in A\) and 
                \(\forall n \in A,\ \S(n) \in A\), 
                then the axiom of induction tells us that \(A = \mathbb{N}_0\). 
                Therefore, the proposition must be true for all natural numbers.
            </p>
