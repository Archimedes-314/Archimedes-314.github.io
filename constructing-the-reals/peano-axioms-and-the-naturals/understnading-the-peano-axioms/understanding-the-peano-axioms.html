                <li> \(0\in\N_0\)</li>

            </ol>
            
            <p>
                In this section, we will look into the meaning and purpose of each axiom.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Notation</h2>
            <p>There are two common definitions of the set \(\N\). Those are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\N := \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\)</li>
                <li>\(\N := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The definition you use depends on context. But within analysis branches, it's common to define
                \(\N := \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\), and \(\N_0 := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}\). That is the definition
                we will be using.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will also be using the function \(\S(n)\) while exploring the Peano Axioms and the construction of
                the reals. This function is called the <em>successor function</em>, and is defined as follows:
                \begin{align*}
                    \S : \N_0 &\to \N_0\\
                    n &\mapsto n+1
                \end{align*}
                So the successor of any natural number returns that number plus \(1\).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why \(0\) Is in the Set of Natural Numbers?</h2>
                --- additive identity and it's use in the definition of basic operations.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2> Why the Successor Function</h2>
            --- Why the successor function is necessary for the axioms.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Start With \(0\)?</h2>
            --- Explain why the negative integers are not in the set of naturals: equivelnce class definition of naturals. 0 is an
            exception do to the reasoning for the first axiom.

        <section>
            <h2>Successor Injectivity</h2>
            --- Why it's necessary to state why the successor function is injective.

            <h2>The Axiom of Induction</h2>
            <h3> What it's saying</h3>
            <p>
                Now we'll look into the fifth axiom:
                \(\underbrace{\forall A\subseteq\N_0}_{\text{Arbitrary Subset}}, \ 
                \underbrace{(0\in A \ \land \ (\forall n \in A, \ \S(n)\in A) )}_{\text{Conditions}} 
                \implies \underbrace{A=\N_0}_{\text{Conclusion}}\) <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This axiom has three main components:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose any subset \(A \subseteq \N_0\).</li>
                    <li>Assume it satisfies the two stated conditions.</li>
                    <li>Conclude the necessary result if the conditions are met.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                Taken together, these say that if an arbitrary subset of the naturals
                satisfies the two conditions, then that subset must be equal to \(\N_0\).
            </p>

            <p>
                The first condition is \(0\in A\), requiring our subset to contain \(0\). The next condition is 
                \(\forall n\in A, \ \S(n)\in A\), meaning that for any member of \(A\), it's successor is also in \(A\).
            </p>
            <p> 
                So if \(0\) is in \(A\) and the successor of all numbers in \(A\) is also in \(A\), that requires 
                \(A=\{0, \S(0), \S(\S(0)), \ldots\}\), which is exactly \(\N_0\).
            </p>

            <h3>Why it's important</h3>
            <p>
                Say we have some proposition \(P\), and we want to prove that the proposition is true for all natural numbers. A simple way to do this
                is to start with the set \(A:=\{n\in\N_0 \ : \ P(n)\text{ is true}\}\) which contains the set of naturals numbers for which
                \(P\) is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we can show \(P(0)\) is true. That is, the proposition is true when the argument is \(0\). If that holds, we can then say
                \(0\in A\).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we assume that \(n \in A\). That is, we assume \(P(n)\) is true for some arbitrary natural number \(n\).  
                Under this assumption, we then show that \(P(\S(n))\) is also true. If we can prove this in a way that doesn't 
                restrict \(n\) to any specific value, that we can claim \(n\in A \implies \S(n)\in A\)
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we've shown that \(0 \in A\) and 
                \(\forall n \in A,\ \S(n) \in A\), 
                then the axiom of induction tells us that \(A = \mathbb{N}_0\). 
                Therefore, the proposition must be true for all natural numbers.
