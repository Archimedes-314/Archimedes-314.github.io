            <h2>Peano Axioms and the Natural Numbers</h2>

            <p>
                It's imperative to understand that the Peano axioms <em><strong>
                do not invent</strong></em> the natural numbers from scratch. 
                The natural numbers have existed for thousands of years before any formal 
                foundation was written down. We already "knew" what \(1,2,3,\dots\)
                were long before modern mathematics existed.
            </p>

            <p>
                When mathematicians began formalising number systems, the question became:
                <em>What basic properties of the natural numbers do we take as self-evident?</em>
                These properties were written down as axioms&mdash;now called the <em>
                Peano axioms</em>&mdash;and capture the essence of the natural numbers, 
                and provide a rigid foundation for the deefinition and properties of the real numbers.
            </p>

        </section>

            <h2>Why Peano Axioms Look "Backwards"</h2>

            <p>
                A common point of confusion is the role of the successor function \(\S(n)\).
                In everyday life, we learn:
            </p>

            <p class="maths">
                \(1 + 1 = 2,\quad 2 + 1 = 3,\quad \text{and so on.}\)
            </p>

            <p>
                But in the Peano framework, this is reversed. We <em><strong>do not</strong></em> start by saying:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Define \(\S(1) = 2\)", and conclusing \(\S(a) = a + 1\).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Instead, we do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Define <strong>addition</strong> recursively:
                    <br>
                    \(a + 0 = a\)  
                    <br>
                    \(a + \S(b) = \S(a + b)\)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And the fact that \( \S(0) = 1, \S(1) = 2,\) etc. is implied from our natural
            understanding of the natural numbers.</p>

            <p>
                Maths isn't taught by constructing logic and then relating it to the world. Instead, 
                we use maths to explain the real world, and then we drill down into the underlying logic.
                Children aren't taught the axioms of arithmetic, derive definitions for numbers, and
                then learn how to map \(\S(\S(0))\) to two apples; we learn that one apple plus one apple 
                is two apples, and only later construct a logical framework to explain this.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Peano axioms simply capture the patterns we already recognise, but in a 
                way that allows more complex number systems (like integers and reals) to be 
                built rigorously.
