            <h2>Basic Overview of the Axioms</h2>
            <p>There is a set \(\N_0\) which we call the <em>natural numbers</em> with the following properties:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> \(0\in\N_0\)</li>
                <li> \(\forall n\in\N_0, \ \S(n)\in\N_0\)</li>
                <li> \(\forall n\in\N_0, \ \S(n)\neq0\)</li>
                <li> \( \forall n,m\in\N_0, \ \S(n)=\S(m)\implies n=m \)</li>
                <li> \(\forall A\subseteq\N_0, \ (0\in A \ \land \ (\forall n \in A, \ \S(n)\in A) ) \implies A=\N_0\)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                These are explored in greater detail in the lessons listed at the bottom of the page. 
                For a deeper understanding about the purpose of these axioms, I encourage you to 
                read everything below.

            <h2>Purpose of the Axioms</h2>
            <p>
                When learning about the foundations of the real numbers, it is common to begin with the <em>Peano axioms</em>, which 
                formalise the basic properties of the natural numbers. The Peano axioms provide a rigorous starting point for 
                defining addition, multiplication, and induction on the natural numbers. From this foundation, we can then 
                construct the integers, rational numbers, and eventually the real numbers using additional definitions and 
                axioms (such as equivalence classes for integers and rationals, and completeness axioms for the reals). The 
                system built upon the Peano axioms is known as <em>Peano Arithmetic</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's imperative to understand that the Peano axioms <strong><em>do not define</em></strong> what the natural numbers 
                explicitly are, but rather, how they behave. When Giuseppe Peano began formalising the natural numbers, the central 
                question became: <em>What basic properties of the natural numbers do we take as so evident and well-established, we 
                can accept without controversy or question</em>? These properties were written down as axioms&mdash;now called the 
                <em>Peano axioms</em>&mdash;and capture the essence of the natural numbers. The axioms specify a small collection of 
                <strong>formal properties</strong> that any system behaving like the natural numbers must satisfy.

            <h2>What Students Often Get Backwards</h2>

            <p>
                A common understanding of the axioms
            </p>

            <p>
                A common point of confusion is the role of the successor function \(\S(n)\).
                In everyday life, we learn:
            </p>

            <p class="maths">
                \(1 + 1 = 2,\quad 2 + 1 = 3,\quad 3 + 1 = 4,\quad\) and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                This remains true in the Peano framework, but the axioms do not define the successor of 
                \(1\) as \(2\), the successor of \(2\) as \(3\), and so on. Instead, the relationship 
                \( \S(0) = 1,\ \S(1) = 2,\ \S(2)=3, \ldots\) are left implicit. 
            </p>



            <p>
                Mathematics isn't taught by constructing logic and then relating it to the world; rather, 
                we use maths to describe the real world, and later drill down into the underlying logic.
                Children aren't taught the axioms of arithmetic, derive definitions for numbers, and
                then learn how to map \(\S(\S(0))\) to two apples; we learn that one apple plus one apple 
                is two apples, and only later construct a logical framework to explain this.
            </p>


            <p>
                The Peano axioms simply formalise the patterns we already recognise, but in a 
                way that allows more complex number systems (like integers and reals) to be 
                built rigorously. Peano Arithmetic assumes a level of mathematical
                maturity; we do not need to completely redefine all the real numbers
                from nothing.
