                <li> There exists a set \( \N_0 \) called the natural numbers.</li>

                For a deeper understanding about the purpose of these axioms, I encourage you to

            <h2>Purpose of the Axioms</h2>

            <p>
                It's imperative to understand that the Peano axioms <em><strong>
                do not invent</strong></em> the natural numbers from nothing. 
                The natural numbers have existed for thousands of years before any formal 
                foundation was written down. We already understood what \(1,2,3,\dots\)
                were long before modern mathematics existed.
            </p>

            <p>
                When mathematician Giuseppe Peano began formalising the natural numbers, the central question became:
                <em>What basic properties of the natural numbers do we take as self-evident?</em>
                These properties were written down as axioms&mdash;now called the <em>
                Peano axioms</em>&mdash;and capture the essence of the natural numbers, 
                providing a rigorous foundation from which the integers, rationals, and reals can be built.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Peano Axioms Look "Backwards"</h2>

            <p>
                A common point of confusion is the role of the successor function \(\S(n)\).
                In everyday life, we learn:
            </p>

            <p class="maths">
                \(1 + 1 = 2,\quad 2 + 1 = 3,\quad \text{and so on.}\)
            </p>

            <p>
                This remains true in the Peano framework, but the axioms do not define the successor of 
                \(1\) as \(2\), the successor of \(2\) as \(3\), and so on. Instead, the relationship \( \S(0) = 1, \S(1) = 2, \ldots\) 
                arise from how we interpret the axioms withing our pre-existing understanding of the natural numbers.
            </p>



            <p>
                Mathematics isn't taught by constructing logic and then relating it to the world; rather, 
                we use maths to describe the real world, and later drill down into the underlying logic.
                Children aren't taught the axioms of arithmetic, derive definitions for numbers, and
                then learn how to map \(\S(\S(0))\) to two apples; we learn that one apple plus one apple 
                is two apples, and only later construct a logical framework to explain this.
            </p>

            

            <p>
                The Peano axioms simply formalise the patterns we already recognise, but in a 
                way that allows more complex number systems (like integers and reals) to be 
                built rigorously.
