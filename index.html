            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <h3>Welcome Message</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my online maths notes! This website is a list of personal mats notes  
                        relating to introductory real analysis. I am entirely self-taught and working on this 
                        project as a hobby, so <strong>there will be typos and minor errors in some 
                        of the content</strong>. 
                        However, I have done my best to ensure everything is as accurate as possible. If you 
                        spot a mistake or want to provide feedback, you can contact me directly at 
                        <a href="mailto:archimedes314notes@gmail.com">archimedes314notes@gmail.com</a>, 
                        or fill out the form on my <a href="/contact/contact.html">Contact Page</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website is a work in progress. New content will be added over time, and I plan 
                        to expand the topics covered in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also included a <a href="/important/settings/settings.html">
                        settings page</a> where you can customise certain aspects 
                        of the site to suit your preferences. At the moment, I only have options
                        for reduced motion, and showing hidden working by default. I am currently 
                        working on a dark mode option, which will be added in a future update. More
                        options will be added over time. You can access the settings page from the 
                        <a onclick="toggleMenu()">menu</a>.

                <h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website explores how mathematical logic can be used to rigorously 
                        construct the real numbers and understand their properties. We begin with 
                        the basics of logic: learning what symbols mean, how to interpret 
                        statements, and how to use logical reasoning to prove mathematical concepts. 
                        Topics include propositional, first-order, and second-order logic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using this foundation, we develop axiomatic systems to define the integers 
                        and rational numbers from the natural numbers, and then construct the 
                        irrational numbers and the real numbers. Along the way, we analyse 
                        fundamental properties of the real number system, including completeness, 
                        density, and incompleteness phenomena.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once we have a solid understanding of the real numbers, we return to logic, 
                        focusing on syntax, semantics, and mathematical conventions. For example, we 
                        examine why implicit multiplication is often given precedence over division, 
                        how such conventions can be formally defined, and what it means for them to 
                        be well-defined and consistent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the future, this website will expand to include lessons on linear 
                        algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics, always with an emphasis 
                        on rigorous logical foundations.

                Unfortunately, mathematics lacks a universal set of notation; symbols, syntax and 
                semantics can have different meanings across textbooks, and some authors even use 
                their own systems. To avoid ambiguity, I will list the notation, syntax, and 
                semantics used throughout this website.

                <h3>End of Proof Markers</h3>

                    <p>
                        In ancient Greek, the phrase <em>ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι</em> (or ΟΕΔ) was commonly 
                        used by mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes to mark the end of a 
                        proof. During the European Renaissance, this was translated into Latin as 
                        <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em> (Q.E.D.).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, in modern mathematics, it is common to use the <em>Halmos symbol</em> 
                        (also known as the <em>tombstone</em>), represented as \(\blacksquare\). 
                        Following standard convention, the tombstone will be used here to indicate 
                        the end of a proof when appropriate.
                    </p>

                <h3>Implied Multiplication</h3>

                    <p>
                        Multiplication can be shown in two ways: with a symbol (such as \(2 \cdot 
                        3\) or \(4 \times 6\)), or without one, by writing values together (such as 
                        \(ab\), which means \(a\) times \(b\)). When a multiplication symbol is 
                        used, the operation is called <em>explicit multiplication</em>. When no 
                        symbol is used, it is called <em>implicit</em> (or <em>implied</em>) 
                        multiplication. You may also see this referred to as <em>multiplication by 
                        juxtaposition</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Depending on the author, implicit multiplication may be parsed with 
                        different binding strength relative to other operations. Here are the two
                        common conventions:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        <strong>High-precedence implicit multiplication.</strong><br>
                        Implicit multiplication is treated as if it were surrounded by brackets, and therefore binds more tightly than division.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Equal-precedence implicit multiplication.</strong><br>
                        Implicit multiplication is treated as having the same precedence as explicit multiplication.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        It is important to understand which convention an author is using, as the 
                        choice can significantly affect the interpretation of an expression. For 
                        example, under the first convention, implicit multiplication always takes 
                        precedence over division, and functions written without brackets are 
                        interpreted as having all immediately following implicitly multiplied 
                        values as part of the function's argument:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>\( 1 / ab = \frac{1}{ab} \)</li>
                        <li>\( \cos ab = \cos(ab) \)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    However, if the second convention were used, the same expressions would instead 
                    be interpreted as:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>\( 1 / ab = \frac{1}{a} \cdot b \)</li>
                        <li>\( \cos ab = \cos(a) \cdot b \)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Either convention is a stylistic choice of notation rather than a logical 
                        necessity. However, the second interpretation is less common in modern 
                        mathematical writing but does appear in some calculators and informal 
                        contexts. Throughout this website, the first convention is used: implicit 
                        multiplication binds more tightly than division. Whenever there is any 
                        possibility of ambiguity, brackets will be used to make the intended meaning 
                        explicit.
