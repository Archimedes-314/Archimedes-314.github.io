                    <p>
                        Welcome to my online maths notes! This website is aimed at students seeking extra 
                        help with introductory real analysis. I am entirely self-taught and working on this 
                        project as a hobby, so <strong>there will be mistakes in some of the content</strong>. However, I 
                        have done my best to ensure everything is as accurate as possible. If you spot a

                <h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website focuses on using mathematical logic to construct the real numbers and 
                        to understand their properties. We first learn about the basics of logic: what the 
                        symbols mean, and how we use them to prove mathematical concepts. From our basic 
                        logic, we can construct a simple axiomatic system to define the integers and 
                        rational numbers in terms of natural numbers, along with operations such as addition 
                        and multiplication. After we have a basic understanding, we return to logic to 
                        develop a deeper understanding, thereby building a stronger system to define the 
                        irrational numbers and strengthening our definitions of the naturals, integers, and 
                        rationals. In the future, this website will be expanded to include lessons on linear 
                        algebra and calculus.

            <h2>Why Rigor Becamse Necessary</h2>
                <p>
                    In everyday life, we often use maths without thinking twice. Whether we are using 
                    arithmetic in cooking or algebra in budgeting, our intuitive approach to maths has 
                    been sufficient for centuries. However, as mathematics expanded to more complex fields, 
                    serious foundational problems began to emerge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early calculus relied heavily on ideas such as "infinitesimally small quantities" and 
                    "instantaneous rate of change". While these concepts led to spectacular success in 
                    engineering and physics, they were not logically precise, and logical errors often 
                    coexisted without clear resolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the early 19th century, this lack of precision had become untenable. Mathematition 
                    began to ask, not just what mathematics could do, but why its methods worked at all.
                </p>
                 
            <h3>A Simple Question That Reveals a Deep Question</h3>
                <p>Take this simple question:</p>
                <p>\(0.999… = 1? \)</p>
                <p>
                    Many informal arguments claim this equality is “obvious”, often using the density 
                    property of the reals. For example, one may argue that if 0.999… and 1 are distinct 
                    real numbers, there must be some number between them.
                </p>

                <div class="example" data-collapsible="true">
                    Take two numbers \(a,b\in\R\) where \(a\lt b\). From the desity property, there must exist a 
                    \( c=(a+b)/2 \in \R \) where \(a \lt c \lt b\)
                    <div class="working">
                        <h4>Working:</h4>
                        For two numbers \(a,b \in \R \), \(a \lt b\) implies:
                        \begin{align*}
                            a &\lt b\\
                            \implies a+a &\lt a+b\\
                            \implies 2a &\lt a+b\\
                            \implies a &\lt \frac{a+b}2\\\\
                        \end{align*}
                        A similar argument shows that:
                        \begin{equation} 
                            a \lt b \implies \frac{a+b}2 \lt b
                        \end{equation}
                        Putting these together results in: \(\displaystyle a \lt \frac{a+b}2 \lt b\)
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Using this idea, one might attempt to argue that there can be no real number strictly between
                    \(0.\bar{9}\) and \(1\), and therefore they must be equal.
                </p>

                <div class="example" data-collapsible="true">
                    There exists no \(x\in\R\) where \( 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1 \)
                    <div class="working">
                        <h4>Working:</h4>
                        Suppose, for contradiction, \(0.\bar{9} \lt 1\). Then, from the previous example, assume
                        that there exists an \(x \in \R\) such that \( 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1 \).

                        Define the decimal \( 0.\bar{9} \) as the limit of the sequence \( (0.\bar{9})_n \) given by:
                        \begin{align*}
                            (0.9)_n &:= \suma{i=1}{n}{\frac{9}{10^i}}\\
                            0.\bar{9} &:= \Lim{n}{\infty}{(0.9)_n}
                        \end{align*}

                        Note that for all \( n \in \N \), we have:
                        \[
                            (0.9)_n \lt 0.\bar{9} \lt x \lt 1
                        \]

                        Now observe:
                        \[
                            (0.9)_n + \frac{1}{10^n} = 1
                        \]
                        
                        This can be proven though induction. Due to the proofs simplicity, it will be left as an excersise
                        for the reader. This results in:

                        \[
                            1-x \lt 1-(0.9)_n = \frac{1}{10^n}
                        \]

                        And since \( 0 \lt x \lt 1 \), it follows that: \( 0 \lt 1-x \lt 10^{-n} \).

                        But by the <em>Archimedean Property</em>*, for every positive real number \(\eps > 0\), there exists 
                        \(n \in \N\) such that \(10^{-n} \lt \eps\). In particular, there is no real number \(x\) such that 
                        \(0 \lt 1 - x \lt 10^{-n}\) for all \(n \in \N\), because \(10^{-n} \To{n}{\infty} 0\). Therefore, 
                        such an \(x\) cannot exist.

                </div>

                <p>
                    However, this reasoning quietly assumes two things:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>That the real numbers genuinely possess the density property.</li>
                    <li>That the infinite decimal \(0.\bar{9}\) already corresponds to a well-defined real number.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    Neither assumption is trivial. In fact, both depend on deeper structural properties of the real
                    number system, properties that themselves must be justified. This raises a fundamental question:
                    <em>How far back must we go before our mathematical claims no longer depend on unexamined
                    assumptions?</em>

            <h2>The History of Analysis</h2>
            <h3>The 19th-Century Foundations of Analysis</h3>

                <p>
                    The first major progress toward rigorous foundations came not from logic, but from analysis.
                    During the early-to-mid 1800s, mathematicians such as Bernard Bolzano, Niels Abel, Augustin-Louis
                    Cauchy, and Karl Weierstrass systematically eliminated the vague notions that had plagued
                    calculus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Limits, continuity, and convergence were reformulated using precise \( \eps \) - \( \delta \)
                    definitions. This work made calculus logically reliable, but it also exposed a deeper problem:
                    the real numbers themselves were being used without a clear definition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In response, several independent constructions of the real numbers emerged later in the 19th
                    century. Richard Dedekind defined real numbers using <em>cuts</em> of the rationals, while Karl
                    Weierstrass and Georg Cantor developed constructions based on Cauchy sequences. These approaches
                    showed that irrational numbers could be rigorously built from rational numbers alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Around the same time, William Rowan Hamilton introduced ordered pairs of real numbers as a
                    foundation for the complex numbers, demonstrating that even seemingly new kinds of numbers
                    could be constructed from simpler ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet another foundational issue remained: the rational numbers themselves depend on the natural
                    numbers. Using ideas developed by H. G. Grassmann and Richard Dedekind, Giuseppe Peano introduced
                    a small collection of axioms that precisely describe the structure of the natural numbers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These <em>Peano axioms</em> do not attempt to prove what numbers are. Instead, they specify how
                    numbers behave. From them, addition, multiplication, and the rational numbers can be
                    systematically constructed.

            <h3>Logicism and Its Limits</h3>
                <p>
                    By the late 19th century, it had become plausible that large portions of mathematics could be
                    derived from a small set of primitive principles. Gottlob Frege sought to show that arithmetic
                    itself could be derived purely from logic, a philosophical position known as <em>logicism</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Frege developed the necessary logical machinery in 1879, and by the 1890s had produced detailed
                    derivations of arithmetic. However, the discovery of paradoxes, most famously Russell's
                    Paradox, revealed deep inconsistencies in naive logical systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In response, Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell collaborated on <em>Principia
                    Mathematica</em>, attempting to rebuild mathematics within a carefully constrained logical
                    framework. While enormously influential, this project ultimately revealed the immense
                    complexity required to formalise even basic arithmetic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the 1930s, Kurt G&ouml;del proved his incompleteness theorems, showing that any sufficiently rich
                    axiomatic system cannot be both complete and capable of proving its own consistency. G&ouml;del did
                    not show that mathematics lacks foundations, but rather that no single system can capture all
                    mathematical truth from within itself.
                </p>

            <h3>What Axioms Really Are</h3>

                <p>
                    Long before modern analysis and logicism, mathematicians were already working axiomatically. In fact, 
                    axioms are among the oldest tools in mathematical logic. Ancient Greek mathematicians, most notably 
                    Euclid, recognised that any systematic body of knowledge must begin somewhere. Rather than attempting 
                    to justify everything from first principles, they started with a small collection of basic assumptions 
                    and reasoning logically from them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These early axioms were not intended to be proven. Instead, they described how fundamental objects were 
                    allowed to behave. Euclid did not attempt to explain what a point or a line <em>is</em> in any philosophical 
                    sense; he stated how points and lines relate to one another. From a handful of such assumptions, he was 
                    able to derive an enormous body of geometric results. This axiomatic approach proved remarkably stable, 
                    dominating mathematics for over two thousand years.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The 19th-century push toward rigour did not reject axioms; it refined them. When analysts like Cauchy and 
                    Weierstrass formalised calculus, and when Dedekind and Cantor constructed the real numbers, they still 
                    relied on unproven starting principles. What changed was not the existence of axioms, but the demand that 
                    they be clearly stated and carefully examined. The goal was no longer intuitive plausibility, but logical 
                    precision.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Logicism, however, went a step further. Its central ambition was to reduce axioms to purely logical truths. 
                    If arithmetic could be derived entirely from logic, then mathematics would no longer need to <em>assume</em> 
                    anything at all. In this sense, logicism was not a refinement of the axiomatic method, but an attempt to go 
                    beyond it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The failure of this project revealed paradoxes in naive logic, the immense complexity of formal reconstructions, 
                    and G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorems, all of which showed that mathematics cannot be grounded purely in logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Modern mathematics, therefore, returns to axioms. Rather than trying to reduce all of mathematics to logic, 
                    as logicism sought to do, modern mathematical analysis and other fields build on axioms to rigorously define 
                    the structure and principles of various mathematical systems. These axioms are no longer viewed merely as 
                    simple intuitive starting points, but as precise, formal statements that shape the logical foundations of 
                    mathematics. In this way, axioms are carefully examined and defined, with attention to their implications 
                    and consistency, often relying on advanced concepts like first-order and second-order logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the sections that follow, we explore the different axioms, their meanings, and how they construct the 
                    real number system. Beginning with axioms for the natural numbers, we will build the integers, rationals, 
                    and then the real numbers step by step. In doing so, we will see that the real number system is the result 
                    of carefully chosen axioms and rigorous logical development.
