            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this overview, I'll introduce the basic syntax and semantics of 
                propositional logic. We will cover the fundamental symbols used in propositional 
                logic, including logical connectives, set-theoretic symbols, and quantifiers. 
                Upon downloading this page as a PDF, you will have a reference guide for the
                symbols and their meanings that will be used throughout the lessons below.

        <section id="section2">
        <h2>What Are Propositions?</h2>
            <p>
                In formal logic, a <em>proposition</em> is a declarative statement that is either 
                true or false, but not both. Propositions are the basic building blocks of logical 
                reasoning and are used to construct more complex statements through logical 
                connectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Propositional logic focuses on the relationships between these propositions and how 
                they can be combined using logical operators such as 'and' (conjunction), 'or' 
                (disjunction), 'not' (negation), 'if...then' (implication), and 'if and only if' 
                (biconditional).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, take the following four different propositions represented by the 
                variables \(r\), \(s\), \(c\), and \(w\):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(r\): It is raining.</li>
                <li>\(s\): The sun is shining.</li>
                <li>\(c\): It is cloudy.</li>
                <li>\(w\): The grass is wet.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Here, each proposition gets a truth value. That is, \(r\), \(s\), \(c\), and \(w\) 
                will be either 'True' or 'False'. We can build more complex propositions by joining 
                these variables with logical operators like negation (\(\neg\)), conjunction 
                (\(\land\)), disjunction (\(\lor\)), and implication (\(\rarrow\)) as shown below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\neg r\): It is not raining.</li>
                <li>\(r \land w\): It is raining and the grass is wet.</li>
                <li>\(s \lor r\): The sun is shining or it is raining.</li>
                <li>\(\neg (r \land s) \rarrow c\): It is neither raining nor is the sun shining, 
                    which means it must be cloudy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                An easy way to remember the difference between \( \land \) for conjunction and 
                \(\lor \) for disjunction is that \( \land \) looks like a capital 'A' for 'and'.
            </p>

            <div class="example" data-collapsible="true">
                <p>Consider the following propositions:

                                9 is an odd number, so \(O(9)\) is true. However, 9 is not a prime number
                                (it is divisible by 3), so \(P(9)\) is false. Since one part of the
                                conjunction is false, the whole conjunction is false.

                                \(\neg P(7)\) is false.

                                (so \(O(2)\) is false), one part of the disjunction is true, and hence the

        <h2>Set-theoretic Symbols</h2>
            <p>
                In formal logic, set-theoretic symbols are used to represent sets and their 
                relationships. If we take the sets \(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(T = \{2, 3, 4\}\), 
                we can use the following symbols to describe their relationships:
            </p>
            <h4>Is an Element Of</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\in\) denotes 'is an element of'. If \(x \in A\), then \(x\) is an 
                element of set \(A\). For example, \(2 \in S\) means that 2 is an element of set
                \(S\), and \(5 \notin T\) means that 5 is not an element of set \(T\). We use 
                these symbols to express membership within sets.
            </p>

            <h4>Is a Subset Of</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\subseteq\) denotes 'is a subset of'. If \(A \subseteq B\), then every 
                element of set \(A\) is also an element of set \(B\). Note that \(A\) may be equal 
                to \(B\). For example, if we have a set \(C = \{2, 3\}\), then \(C \subseteq S\) 
                because all elements of \(C\) (which are 2 and 3) are also elements of \(S\). 
                However, \(S \not\subseteq T\) because \(S\) contains the element 1, which is not 
                in \(T\).
            </p>

            <h4>Is a Proper Subset Of</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\subset\) denotes 'is a proper subset of'. If \(A \subset B\), then 
                every element of set \(A\) is an element of set \(B\). However, \(A\) is not equal 
                to \(B\). For example, using the same sets \(C\) and \(S\) as before, we can say that 
                \(C \subset S\) because all elements of \(C\) are in \(S\), and \(C\) is not equal 
                to \(S\).
            </p>

            <p>
                It's important to note that the definition of this symbol (\(\subset\)) changes 
                depending on the author. In some texts, \(\subset\) is used to denote 'is a subset 
                of', while in others, it denotes 'is a proper subset of'. Throughout this website,
                the symbol \(\subseteq\) will be used to denote 'is a subset of', and \(\subset\) 
                will be used to denote 'is a proper subset of'.
            </p>

            <h4>Union</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\cup\) denotes 'union'. The union of sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set 
                of all elements that are in either \(A\) or \(B\). For example, the union of sets
                \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \cup T = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
            </p>

            <h4>Intersection</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\cap\) denotes 'intersection'. The intersection of sets \(A\) and 
                \(B\) is the set of all elements that are in both \(A\) and \(B\). For example, the
                intersection of sets \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \cap T = \{2, 3\}\). If there are 
                no common elements between the two sets, their intersection is the empty set, 
                denoted by \(\emptyset\). For example, if we have sets \(U = \{5, 6\}\) and 
                \(V = \{7, 8\}\), then \(U \cap V = \emptyset\).
            </p>

            <h4>Set Difference</h4>
            <p>
                The symbol \(\setminus\) denotes 'set difference'. The set difference of sets 
                \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of all elements that are in \(A\) but not in \(B\).
                For example, the set difference of sets \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \setminus T = 
                \{1\}\), since 1 is in \(S\) but not in \(T\). If we take the sets 
                \(U = \{5, 6, 7, 8\}\) and \(V = \{6, 7\}\), then the set difference is
                \(U \setminus V = \{5, 8\}\).
            </p>

            <h4>Such That</h4>
            <p>
                The symbols \(\mid\) and \(:\) both denote 'such that'. They are often used in 
                set-builder notation to define a set by specifying a property that its members 
                must satisfy. For example, the set of all even natural numbers can be defined as: 
                \(\{x \in \N_0 : x \text{ is even}\}\). This reads as 'the set of all \(x\) in 
                the natural numbers such that \(x\) is even'.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this website, the symbol \(:\) will be primarily used to denote 'such that'.
                This is to avoid confusion, as the vertical bar symbol \(\mid\) is also
                used in number theory to denote 'divides'. For example, \(a \mid b\) means That
                \(a\) is a divisor of \(b\) (i.e., \(b\) is divisible by \(a\)).

            <h4>The Set of Real Numbers (and its Subsets)</h4>
            <p>
                The set of real numbers and its subsets are represented by the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\R\): The set of real numbers.</li>
                <li>\(\Q\): The set of rational numbers.</li>
                <li>\(\Z\): The set of integers.</li>
                <li>\(\N_0\): The set of natural numbers.</li>
                <li>\(\N\): The set of natural numbers excluding zero.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There is no specific symbol for the set of irrational numbers, 
                but they can be represented as \(\R \setminus \Q\), which denotes the set of all 
                real numbers that are not rational. Some authors may use custom definition, such 
                as \(\mathbb{P} = \{ x : x \in \R \land x \notin \Q \}\), to denote the set of 
                irrational numbers. However, this website will use the set difference notation 
                \(\R \setminus \Q\) for the irrational numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that some authors define the set of natural numbers \(\N\) to include zero, 
                while others define it to start from one. In this website, we will use \(\N_0\) 
                to denote the set of natural numbers including zero, and \(\N\) to denote the set 
                of natural numbers excluding zero. When referring to the 'natural numbers', it
                should be implied that I am referring to \(\N_0\) unless context implies otherwise.
                If there is any ambiguity, clarification will be provided.
            </p>

            <p>
                The set of integers \(\Z\) includes the natural numbers (including 0), and the
                negative numbers. Using some basic notation, we can define the following variations
                of the set of integers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\Z_{\lt 0}\): The set of negative integers (i.e., \( \{-1, -2, -3, \ldots\} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\Z_{\leq 0}\): The set of negative integers including zero (i.e., \( \{0, -1, -2, -3, \ldots\} \)).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Similarly, we can define variations of the set of rational numbers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\Q^+\): The set of positive rational numbers (i.e., \( \{ x \in \Q : x \gt 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\Q_0^+\): The set of positive rational numbers including zero (i.e., \( \{ x \in \Q : x \geq 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\Q^-\): The set of negative rational numbers (i.e., \( \{ x \in \Q : x \lt 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\Q_0^-\): The set of negative rational numbers including zero (i.e., \( \{ x \in \Q : x \leq 0 \} \)).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Similar notation can be applied to the set of real numbers \(\R\) as well:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\R^+\): The set of positive real numbers (i.e., \( \{ x \in \R : x \gt 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\R_0^+\): The set of positive real numbers including zero (i.e., \( \{ x \in \R : x \geq 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\R^-\): The set of negative real numbers (i.e., \( \{ x \in \R : x \lt 0 \} \)).</li>
                <li>\(\R_0^-\): The set of negative real numbers including zero (i.e., \( \{ x \in \R : x \leq 0 \} \)).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that some of these defintions are not universally standard; always
                check the definitions being used in any given text. The sets defined above will be
                used consistently throughout this website. Clarification will often coincide
                with the use of these definitions to avoid any confusion.

        <h2>Universal and Existential Quantifiers</h2>
            <p>
                Quantifiers are symbols that tell us how many members of a set or group a statement 
                applies to. Instead of talking about just one particular object, quantifiers allow 
                us to make statements about all objects in a group or about the existence of at 
                least one object with a certain property. 
            </p>

            <h4>Universal Quantifier</h4>
            <p>
                The universal quantifier is denoted by the symbol \(\forall\) and is read as 
                'for all' or 'for every'. It is used to indicate that a statement applies to all 
                elements in a particular set or domain. For example, we'll take the following
                propositions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(P(x)\): \(x\) is prime greater than 2.</li>
                <li>\(O(x)\): \(x\) is odd.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are both propositions because they can be either true or false depending on 
                the value of \(x\). For example, if \(x = 5\), then \(P(5)\) is true and \(O(5)\) 
                is true. However, if \(x = 4\), then \(P(4)\) is false and \(O(4)\) is false. 
                Using the universal quantifier, we can express the statement that all prime numbers 
                greater than 2 are odd as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                \(\forall x (P(x) \rarrow O(x))\), which reads: 'for all values of \(x\), if 
                \(x\) is prime greater than 2, then \(x\) is odd.'
            </p>

            <h4>Existential Quantifier</h4>
            <p>
                The existential quantifier is denoted by the symbol \(\exists\) and is read as 
                'there exists' or 'there is at least one'. It is used to indicate that there is 
                at least one element in a particular set or domain that satisfies a given 
                property. For example, the statement \(\exists x ( x \in \R \land x^2 = 4)\) 
                means 'there exist a number \(x\) where \(x\) is a real number and \(x\) squared 
                equals 4', or more naturally, 'there exists a real number whose square is 4'. 
                In this case, the values \(x = 2\) and \(x = -2\) both satisfy the property.
