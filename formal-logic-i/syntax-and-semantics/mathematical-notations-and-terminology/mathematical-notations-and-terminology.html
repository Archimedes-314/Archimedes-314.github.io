            <h2>Sets</h2>
            <p>
                A set is a collection of objects considered as a single entity. The objects in a set 
                are called its elements or members. Sets can contain any kind of object, such as 
                numbers, symbols, or even other sets. One common way to formally define a set is to 
                list its elements inside curly brackets. For example, the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) 
                contains the elements \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\).
            </p>

            <p>
                The order in which we list the elements does not matter, and repeating elements does 
                not change the set. So, \(\{3, 1, 1, 1, 2\}\) is the same as \(\{1, 2, 3\}\). If we 
                want to keep track of how many times each element appears, we use the term multiset 
                instead of set. For instance, \(\{3\}\) and \(\{3, 3\}\) are different as multisets 
                but are the same as sets. 
            </p>

            <p>
                An infinite set has infinitely many elements. Since we cannot list all the elements 
                of an infinite set, we often use the notation '\(\ldots\)' to indicate that the 
                sequence continues forever.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can use set-builder notation to describe a set containing elements according to 
                some rule, which is often in the form \(\{n : [\text{rule about } n]\}\). For 
                example, the set \(\{n \in \R : 2 \mid n\}\) represents the set of all real numbers 
                such that \(n\) is divisible by \(2\).

                                We start by letting \(x\) be in some set \(A\), and let some 
                                proposition \(P\) be false for all values of \(x\). This means 
                                \(P(x)\) will always be false. We can then set the empty set to be 
                                the set of values \(x\) where \(P(x)\) is true. This is a 
                                contradiction, leading to the set being empty. An example of this is 
                                \(\{ x : x \neq x\}\).

            <h2>Set-Theoretic Symbols</h2>
                <p>
                    In formal logic, set-theoretic symbols are used to represent sets and their 
                    relationships. If we take the sets \(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(T = \{2, 3, 4\}\), 
                    we can use the following symbols to describe their relationships:
                </p>
                <h4>Is an Element Of</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\in\) denotes 'is an element of'. If \(x \in A\), then \(x\) is an 
                    element of set \(A\). For example, \(2 \in S\) means that 2 is an element of set
                    \(S\), and \(5 \notin T\) means that 5 is not an element of set \(T\). We use 
                    these symbols to express membership within sets.
                </p>

                <h4>Is a Subset Of</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\subseteq\) denotes 'is a subset of'. If \(A \subseteq B\), then every 
                    element of set \(A\) is also an element of set \(B\). Note that \(A\) may be equal 
                    to \(B\). For example, if we have a set \(C = \{2, 3\}\), then \(C \subseteq S\) 
                    because all elements of \(C\) (which are 2 and 3) are also elements of \(S\). 
                    However, \(S \not\subseteq T\) because \(S\) contains the element 1, which is not 
                    in \(T\).
                </p>

                <img src="/assets/plots/videos/BooleanOperationsSubset.gif" controls style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; height: auto;">

                <h4>Is a Proper Subset Of</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\subset\) denotes 'is a proper subset of'. If \(A \subset B\), then 
                    every element of set \(A\) is an element of set \(B\). However, \(A\) is not equal 
                    to \(B\). For example, using the same sets \(C\) and \(S\) as before, we can say that 
                    \(C \subset S\) because all elements of \(C\) are in \(S\), and \(C\) is not equal 
                    to \(S\).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's important to note that the definition of this symbol (\(\subset\)) changes 
                    depending on the author. In some texts, \(\subset\) is used to denote 'is a subset 
                    of', while in others, it denotes 'is a proper subset of'. Throughout this website,
                    the symbol \(\subseteq\) will be used to denote 'is a subset of', and \(\subset\) 
                    will be used to denote 'is a proper subset of'.
                </p>

                <h4>Union</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\cup\) denotes 'union'. The union of sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set 
                    of all elements that are in either \(A\) or \(B\). For example, the union of sets
                    \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \cup T = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
                </p>

                <img src="/assets/plots/videos/BooleanOperationsUnion.gif" controls style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; height: auto;">

                <h4>Intersection</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\cap\) denotes 'intersection'. The intersection of sets \(A\) and 
                    \(B\) is the set of all elements that are in both \(A\) and \(B\). For example, the
                    intersection of sets \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \cap T = \{2, 3\}\). If there are 
                    no common elements between the two sets, their intersection is the empty set, 
                    denoted by \(\emptyset\). For example, if we have sets \(U = \{5, 6\}\) and 
                    \(V = \{7, 8\}\), then \(U \cap V = \emptyset\).
                </p>

                <img src="/assets/plots/videos/BooleanOperationsIntersection.gif" controls style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; height: auto;">

                <h4>Set Difference</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol \(\setminus\) denotes 'set difference'. The set difference of sets 
                    \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of all elements that are in \(A\) but not in \(B\).
                    For example, the set difference of sets \(S\) and \(T\) is given by: \(S \setminus T = 
                    \{1\}\), since 1 is in \(S\) but not in \(T\). If we take the sets 
                    \(U = \{5, 6, 7, 8\}\) and \(V = \{6, 7\}\), then the set difference is

                <h4>Such That</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbols \(\mid\) and \(:\) both denote 'such that'. They are often used in 
                    set-builder notation to define a set by specifying a property that its members 
                    must satisfy. For example, the set of all even natural numbers can be defined as: 
                    \(\{x \in \N_0 : x \text{ is even}\}\). This reads as 'the set of all \(x\) in 
                    the natural numbers such that \(x\) is even'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this website, the symbol \(:\) will be primarily used to denote 'such that'.
                    This is to avoid confusion, as the vertical bar symbol \(\mid\) is also
                    used in number theory to denote 'divides'. For example, \(a \mid b\) means That
                    \(a\) is a divisor of \(b\) (i.e., \(b\) is divisible by \(a\)).
                </p>

                <h4>The Set of Real Numbers (and its Subsets)</h4>
                <p>
                    The set of real numbers and its subsets are represented by the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(\R\): The set of real numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\Q\): The set of rational numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\Z\): The set of integers.</li>
                    <li>\(\N_0\): The set of natural numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\N\): The set of natural numbers excluding zero.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is no specific symbol for the set of irrational numbers, 
                    but they can be represented as \(\R \setminus \Q\), which denotes the set of all 
                    real numbers that are not rational. Some authors may use custom definition, such 
                    as \(\mathbb{P} = \{ x : x \in \R \land x \notin \Q \}\), to denote the set of 
                    irrational numbers. However, this website will use the set difference notation 
                    \(\R \setminus \Q\) for the irrational numbers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that some authors define the set of natural numbers \(\N\) to include zero, 
                    while others define it to start from one. In this website, I will use \(\N_0\) 
                    to denote the set of natural numbers including zero, and \(\N\) to denote the set 
                    of natural numbers excluding zero. When referring to the 'natural numbers', it
                    should be implied that I am referring to \(\N_0\) unless context implies otherwise.
                    If there is any ambiguity, clarification will be provided.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The set of integers \(\Z\) includes the natural numbers (including 0), and the
                    negative numbers. Using set builder notation, we can define the following variations
                    of the set of integers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\( \Z_{\lt 0} = \{ x \in \Z : x \lt 0 \} \): The set of negative integers (i.e., \( \{-1, -2, -3, \ldots\} \)).</li>
                    <li>\( \Z_{\leq 0} = \{ x \in \Z : x \leq 0 \} \): The set of negative integers including zero (i.e., \( \{0, -1, -2, -3, \ldots\} \)).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Similarly, we can define variations of the set of rational numbers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(\Q_{\gt 0} = \{ x \in \Q : x \gt 0 \}\): The set of positive rational numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\Q_{\geq 0} = \{ x \in \Q : x \geq 0 \}\): The set of non-negative rational numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\Q_{\lt 0} = \{ x \in \Q : x \lt 0 \}\): The set of negative rational numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\Q_{\leq 0} = \{ x \in \Q : x \leq 0 \}\): The set of non-positive rational numbers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Similar notation can be applied to the set of real numbers \(\R\) as well:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(\R_{\gt 0} = \{ x \in \R : x \gt 0 \} = (0, \infty)\): The set of positive real numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\R_{\geq 0} = \{ x \in \R : x \geq 0 \} = [0, \infty) \): The set of positive real numbers including zero.</li>
                    <li>\(\R_{\lt 0} = \{ x \in \R : x \lt 0 \} = (-\infty, 0)\): The set of negative real numbers.</li>
                    <li>\(\R_{\leq 0} = \{ x \in \R : x \leq 0 \} = (-\infty, 0]\): The set of negative real numbers including zero.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some authors may use other notation notation to represent subsets (for example,
                    \( \R^+ \) can represent the non-negative real numbers). However, I've decieded
                    to use the above notation to ensure carity as to whether 0 is or is not included 
                    in the subsets. Set builder notation will be used if clarification is needed.

            <h2 class="section-title">Universal and Existential Quantifiers</h2>
                <h4>Universal Quantifier</h4>
                <p>
                    The universal quantifier is denoted by the symbol \(\forall\) and is read as 
                    'for all' or 'for every'. It is used to indicate that a statement applies to all 
                    elements in a particular set or domain. For example, we'll take the following
                    propositions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(P(x)\): \(x\) is prime greater than 2.</li>
                    <li>\(O(x)\): \(x\) is odd.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are both propositions because they can be either true or false depending on 
                    the value of \(x\). For example, if \(x = 5\), then \(P(5)\) is true and \(O(5)\) 
                    is true. However, if \(x = 4\), then \(P(4)\) is false and \(O(4)\) is false. 
                    Using the universal quantifier, we can express the statement that all prime numbers 
                    greater than 2 are odd as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    \(\forall x (P(x) \rarrow O(x))\), which reads: 'for all values of \(x\), if 
                    \(x\) is prime greater than 2, then \(x\) is odd.'
                </p>

                <h4>Existential Quantifier</h4>
                <p>
                    The existential quantifier is denoted by the symbol \(\exists\) and is read as 
                    'there exists' or 'there is at least one'. It is used to indicate that there is 
                    at least one element in a particular set or domain that satisfies a given 
                    property. For example, the statement \(\exists x ( x \in \R \land x^2 = 4)\) 
                    means 'there exist a number \(x\) where \(x\) is a real number and \(x\) squared 
                    equals 4', or more naturally, 'there exists a real number whose square is 4'. 
                    In this case, the values \(x = 2\) and \(x = -2\) both satisfy the property.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The notation \(\exists!\) is used to represent 'there exists exactly one'. For example,
                    \(\exists! n( n \in \N \land n^2 = n )\). This means 'there exists a unique positive 
                    integer which is equal to its square'. That unique positive integer is \(1\).
                </p>

                                    \(x\) must equal \(3n - 2\) for every \(n \in \N\). However, 
                                    \(3n - 2\) takes on multiplie <span class="nb">values (\(1, 3, 7, \cdots\))</span>, and

                                <p class="reason"><strong>Reason:</strong>
                                    We need exactly one integer \(n\) such that both \(n \lt 8\) and \(n^2 = x\) hold.
                                    For \(x=0\), only \(n=0\) satisfies \(n^2=0\), so \(x=0\) is valid.
                                    For any positive square \(x = k^2\) with \(k \lt 8\), both \(n = k\) and \(n = -k\) satisfy
                                    \(n^2 = x\) and \(n \lt 8\), so there are two solutions, which is not allowed.
                                    If \(k \ge 8\), then \(+k\) does not satisfy \(n \lt 8\), but \(-k\) does, so there is
                                    exactly one solution.
                                    Therefore the set contains \(0\) and all squares \(k^2\) where \(k\in\Z\) and \(k \leq -8\).
                                    Because \(k^2 = (-k)^2\), an equivalent set is \(\{0\} \cup \{ n^2 : n \in \Z \land n \geq 8 \}\).
